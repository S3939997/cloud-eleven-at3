      <h1>IT Technologies</h1>
      <p>There are a lot of fascinating developments going on in the IT world, many may fall by the wayside, but some may change the way the world works. The Cloud 11 team explore four emerging IT Technologies Autonomous Vehicles; Cloud, Services, Servers; Cybersecurity; and Machine Learning.

      <h1>Autonomous Vehicles</h1>
      <article>
        <p>Long predicted to be the way of the future, autonomous vehicles have come along way over the last few years. With it being a major focus for both tech companies and vehicle manufacturers alike, everyone seems to be trialling new ways to implement a driver less technology.</p>
        <button class="collapsible">What does it do?</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>By definition, autonomous vehicles are ones that are “capable of sensing its environment and operating without human involvement.” (What is an autonomous car? – how self-driving cars work, n.d.) While we are not yet at full automation in vehicles, many companies are making big strides towards that reality.</p>
          <p>The technology behind vehicle autonomy is a complex combination of vehicles utilising a series of sensors and cameras to create a map of the world around them, and on-board machine learning and AI systems to mimic the functionality of a human driver. At its core, autonomy in vehicles falls into five differing classes, each one decreasing the need for human interaction with the vehicle.</p>
        	<p>Starting at 0, which is no automation at all, we go to the most basic level that most cars today are equipped with which is level 1, which includes the likes of cruise control, where the driver is still required to be fully aware of surroundings and in control of their vehicle. Level 2 is what most people think of when they think of automation seen today, with cars having an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) which covers applications of things such as “pedestrian detection and avoidance, lane departure warning and correction, traffic sign recognition, automatic emergency braking, and blind spot detection”. (What is ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems)?, n.d.)</p>
        	<p>From level 3 we start to see much more automation by having vehicles where in some situations, the car fully drives itself and the driver can take their eyes off the road. The vehicle still needs driver intervention, such as at above certain speeds or when the car requests the user to take control.</p>
        	<p>At level 4, “the car is capable of steering, braking, accelerating, decelerating, monitoring the vehicle and external environment as well as responding to events in real-time and determining when to change lanes, turn, and use signals”. (Chaturvedi, 2018) The vehicle would assess the area before allowing the driver to enter this mode of travel. Level 5 is where we see full automation of the vehicle and it becomes truly autonomous. It is at this point that “vehicles remove limitations entirely and can basically drive themselves anywhere a human could.” (Day, 2021)</p>
        	<p>Predominantly, we see only level 1 and level 2 vehicle automation in the market globally, however some businesses, such as Honda and Mercedes, are set to launch level 3 autonomous vehicles in the coming years. The seemingly most advanced company regarding the autonomous vehicle spectrum however is the Google owned Waymo. Having trialled autonomous vehicles with a driver assist in their hometown of Phoenix, Arizona, for many years, they have recently begun application of a level 5 vehicle with no driver on the streets of San Francisco. According to Nedelea (2022), it is only able to drive certain areas and the no safety driver option is only available to Waymo staff as the laws of incidents with the public in an unmanned vehicle is still very new.</p>
        	<p>With further improvements to the technology and a subsequent lowering in price of vehicles with the technology, it would be feasible to say that in the next 10 years there will at least be a lot more level 2 and 3 autonomous vehicles on our roads, with the potential of level 4 and 5 having functioning versions out there at a much higher price point.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">What is the likely impact?</button>
        <div class="content">
        	<p>The implications of widespread use of this technology are many. For example, autonomous vehicles could completely change the taxi services system we use today. If a business was able to secure a fleet of level 5 autonomous vehicles, it would revolutionise the industry. It would truly be the culmination of a sci fi dream where vehicles would be not only driverless but have a full onboard AI system to take them where they wanted to go. Taking it one step further would be the automation of things like cargo trucks and delivery vehicles. This would prove harmful to an entire industry of drivers as many of them would be replaced and could cause mass unemployment.</p>
        	<p>There are also dangers to the advancement of this technology. As vehicles become more capable of automation, drivers may become more complacent and lazier on the road. This poses a safety risk as with all technology things can go wrong, and people need to be able to step in when necessary. To this day there already cases of death and injury from drivers believing they can just stop paying attention to the road because their car will drive itself. </p>
        	<p>Recently in Melbourne, Australia, a person boarding a tram was hit by a Tesla in its auto pilot mode. After the car “allegedly dragged the victim 15 to 20 metres” (Fowler, 2022) the driver fled the scene, returning later in hysterics. In this situation the driver was at fault, but it raises the question of if a fully automated vehicle were to be in an accident who would be to blame? If two automated vehicles crashed into each other, how would insurance determine fault and cover costs? These are the type of questions that are being asked today in the lead up to further advancement in driverless technology.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">How will this affect you?</button>
        <div class="content">
        	<p>Personally, I do not believe the developments in this technology would have any direct influence on me or my family and friends in its current state as far as owning a form of autonomous vehicle as the tech is something that is predominantly seen in higher end or specialised vehicles and as such is something that is currently only accessible to the wealthier person. However, I feel as the tech develops, it may become more commonplace, such as in the way things like cruise control have, and as such the market becomes more saturated and prices would drop. This would mean that it would eventually be a more feasible investment for everyone something attainable for me.</p>
        	<p>That said, the switch to autonomous vehicles for businesses could have more wide-reaching benefits for all. It could increase efficiencies in deliveries by removing an element of human error, and it could mean that many things get to where they need to be much faster than they currently do. Delivery time frames could also be improved by having things delivered in the middle of the night when roads are empty therefore freeing up roads from truck congestion during the day.</p>
        	<p>It is also predicted that the change to autonomous vehicles would see a lowering in traffic on roads, increasing the efficiency in travel times for all. A flow on benefit of this would be the reduction in CO2 emissions, helping both the environment and air quality, and as long-suffering asthmatic this would definitely be a plus. On the health side of things, with the state of the world with diseases such as Covid, a reduction in human interaction could also be beneficial as it could be a way to transport people that are sick from place to place without the need of risking another’s health.</p>

      <h1>Cloud, Services, Servers</h1>
      <article>
        <p>Cloud services is the delivery of information technology or computing technologies to organisations over the internet. Organisations are able to access the technology on demand and only need to pay for what they need when they need it. They are able to use Public, Private or Hybrid cloud services depending on their business needs.</p>
        <button class="collapsible">What does it do?</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Through cloud services, organisations are essentially able to rent their information technology infrastructure including applications from Software as a Service (SaaS) providers, collaborative software testing and development platforms from Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers and physical or virtual servers, storage and networking from Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers.</p>
          <p>A Platform as a Service product is like a sandbox on the internet, where developers or software creators can collaborate in building and testing their applications that may eventually be ready to provide to customers. A software as a service product is an application or suite of applications that is available over the internet for consumers like you or me. There might be versions of it still being constantly tweaked and improved in a PaaS environment behind the scenes, but the consumer or user sees and accesses the most up to date functioning product available. They can access it anywhere and on any device that can access the internet.</p>
          <p>Before the emergence of cloud services, organisations needed to purchase, resource, and maintain hardware for their own on-premises data centre, located in their business. In some circumstances large organisations would need to have rooms full of hardware to host all their systems. To access those systems staff would need to be on premise. Hardware would need to be constantly maintained and upgraded to cope with the increasing processing power required due to technological advances. Cloud services allow organisations to only pay a provider for what they use, when they use it rather than paying upfront for their own infrastructure. Paying as you go allows you to scale your business operation at any time, giving you complete purchasing power over the cloud infrastructure. With many Cloud service providers (such as Amazon and Google) using the advancement on technology and shifting to renewable energy resources for powering their cloud operations this creates a far more environmentally friendly and puts them on the pathway, to being completely carbon neutral.</p>
          <p>Whilst the term ‘cloud computing’ has been floating around since the early 2000s the concept of renting infrastructure has been around for much longer. Due to the costs associated with owning and operating computer mainframes back in the 1960s, Universities such as MIT and Dartmouth College started offering what was known as ‘Timesharing’. This would allow users who couldn’t afford to have their own computers access to shared systems. Then came the invention of personal computers and other technological advances, but the concept of renting computing services continued. In the early 2000s Software as a Service (SaaS) really started to emerge along with hyperscale cloud computing providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure.</p>
          <p>Cloud computing was made possible through the discovery of virtualisation. In essence, virtualisation allows one computer to act and perform as if it was many computers. So one powerful piece of computer hardware is loaded up with a piece of software that forms a layer in-between that computer’s hardware and the Operating System/s that are running off that computer, this layer is called a hypervisor and a hypervisor can have many operating systems running on top of it as opposed to one piece of hardware running one operating system. There are two different types of hypervisors, type one is loaded on to a physical server. Type two is loaded on to an operating system on a personal computer like any other application would. This technology is then scalable and through the use of automation, many users are able access the computing power they require.</p>
          <p>Whilst it might be easy to think that cloud services means that the data and computing services you are accessing on your computer are not physically stored in any one place, it’s a little more complex than that, different organisations will have different security requirements. An Australian organisation might require their data to be stored in Australia. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers are able to make use of large data centres all across the globe, in fact <a href="https://datacentremagazine.com/top10/top-10-countries-most-data-centres" target="_blank">Data Centre Magazine [1]</a> found there were 272 data centres in Australia as at September 2021. Some are set up with their own power sources and are fully self-sufficient providing additional data security for organisations.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">What is the likely impact?</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Whilst the benefits and advantages of cloud computing will vary for every organisation, the main benefit will be around cost savings. No longer needing to buy and maintain infrastructure will present a big advantage. Organisations should be able to move faster on projects and they’ll be able to test out new strategies without committing to long term procurement as they only need to pay for what they are using.</p>
          <p>With more and more organisations turning to cloud services, there will continue to be impacts and changes to workforces and working environments. Along with cost reductions for organisations a significant amount of real estate and hardware will no longer be required in offices so there will be a reduction in the space required by organisations. Combined with the aftereffects of the recent global pandemic shifting many workplaces into work from home arrangements, city CBDs across the globe will see significant change. There is also the potential for a lot of hardware waste as old hardware is discarded or sold off. It will be important for the IT industry to look to recycling services to reduce waste and ensure the transition is sustainable. The good news is that computers and computer accessories can be recycled. In Australia the Australian Government has a National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme in place and there are state based Sustainability programs in place to assist with the ever-increasing amount of e-waste produced.</p>
          <p>Without server hardware to maintain and upgrade, roles such as Server Administrators and On-Premise Data Engineers will no longer be needed by organisations, staff will need to be upskilled to work with different technology. Cloud Administrators, Cloud Security Analysts, Cloud Network Engineers, Cloud Automaton Engineers and Cloud Consultants are now in increasing demand across many industry's.</p>
          <p>Some organisations will be hesitant to move to cloud computing. The cost of migrating in the short term can be inhibitive. Others will have security and privacy concerns when it comes to sensitive data being stored off premises.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">How will this affect you?</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>The development of cloud services is already affecting me in my current role as a Senior Analyst, Business Systems at a university. Our IT Infrastructure is already well on its way to being migrated to the cloud. Without this in place our workplace may have been more strongly affected by the global pandemic, however we were quickly able to move to working from home, online teaching and learning and with the affects of the pandemic receding, many of this will remain in place. Our university is embracing hybrid working which would not be possible if our data structures were not housed in the cloud.</p>
          <p>Through the adoption of cloud services I am able to reduce commuting times to work as I can work from home. This additional time has given me the opportunity to take on university study to build my knowledge and open new career opportunities. I no longer need to be on premise for many jobs in the IT sector. I could be working for an organisation in the United States or Europe and work from the comfort of my home in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
          <p>Having moved to a capital city from regional Australia, the continued development and adoption of cloud services may allow the opportunity to return to the regions and be closer to family. In turn cloud services could help bring further opportunities and access to healthcare and other services to regional areas with the decentralisation of workforces driving population growth.</p>
          <p>There are no doubt many unknowns with cloud computing services as there is with all emerging technologies, but there is no doubt that now that it is here, it will continue to play a part in the lives of all people across the globe.</p>

      <h1>Cybersecurity</h1>
      <article>
        <p>Cybersecurity is the field of protecting information systems from threats and attacks. These information systems include computers, servers, Information of Things (IoT) devices, mobile phones and network infrastructure. As information technology improves and the world is getting more connected than ever before, the threat landscape for organizations and individuals using these information systems is also growing. Particularly those systems which are connected on the same networks, especially those on the Internet.</p>
        <button class="collapsible">What does it do?</button>
        <div class="content">
        <p>A market overview provided by <i>CompTIA</i> (2021), a well-known name in the cybersecurity space for certifying security professionals, shows concerning statistics regarding threats which can be mitigated with better cybersecurity:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Average cost of a data breach | $4.24 million</li>
          <li>Average number of days to identify and contain a data breach | 287</li>
          <li>Number of new malware programs found per day | 350K</li>
          <li>Average cost of remediating a ransomware attack | $1.85 million</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A key development in the Cybersecurity is the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence with cybersecurity prevention and detection software. Challenges of analyzing large scale data sets and behaviors on information systems are being overcome with the use artificial intelligence and machine learning to keep up with the fast evolving and unique attacks.</p>
        <p>An example of a prevalent style of attack seen in cybersecurity is the use of phishing and spear phishing campaigns (a type of phishing where phishing communications are curated for the specific targe individual or organization). A user may be sent an email from what looks like a trusted organization, or their own organization, requesting personal or critical information (such as credentials or payment information). Once the user divulges the information to the attacker, a ripple of effects which can quickly get out of control resulting in serious disruption and damages can occur. Improved detection and prevention methods in software/services from AI and machine learning are mitigating these attacks, proving to be highly effective. </p>
        <p>A guide by <i>Deloitte</i> (2016) clearly lays out what can be done by organizations (and really, individuals too) to establish a strong cybersecurity posture. It is summarized well in 5 points:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Know your crown jewels and understand friends’ roles,
            <p>Understand what valuable information in your network is and understand how 3rd parties of your valuable information are connected. Does a third-party organization have too much access to information that they shouldn’t have? </p></li>
          <li>Proactively assess your cyber risk,
            <p>As your organization grows and develops over time, ensure that regular cyber risk assessments are made to reflect the changes from growth and development. Adopt cyber threat intelligence capabilities with external and internal intelligence.</p></li>
          <li>Make awareness a priority,
            <p>Ensure that everybody in the organization has cybersecurity awareness as a habit. Keep the topic of maintaining integrity and security in a user -friendly manner as part of the organization’s operations.</p></li>
          <li>Fortify your organization,
            <p>Minimize vulnerabilities in the organization. Keep software and systems security up to date. Identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities that can hinder cybersecurity and improve them.</p></li>
          <li>Prepare for the inevitable,
            <p>Have a plan for managing incidents that result in a breach of cybersecurity. Simulate instances which keep the organization prepared on how to act.</p></li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">What is the likely impact?</button>
        <div class="content">
        <p>The development of cybersecurity would result in information systems functioning safer and as-intended, with less threats being able to compromise data, disrupt networks and damage individuals or organizations. This doesn’t mean that users of the information systems should act any less secure, as a significant component of cybersecurity is the ability of the users of the information systems to remain secure with good habits. With less breaches and compromise, greater levels of innovation would come from businesses having confidence with information systems. </p>
        <p>Aside from there being positive benefits to cybersecurity improvements, attackers and bad actors will also improve resulting in more unique and advanced attack styles. Cybersecurity specialists would have further granular roles, specializing in areas of cybersecurity as opposed to cybersecurity. Smaller and mid-sized organizations would have to further rely on service-providers to feasibly defend themselves within budget as the attack vector becomes more overwhelming with advanced attacks. Individuals and consumers would be more reliant on their platforms/OS of choice to have inherently secure designs.</p>
        <p>This will create significantly more jobs as we can see in the current economic climate and forecasts. As described above, there will be a need for cybersecurity professionals with varying specialties in their field, whether that be network security, application security, physical security, or social engineering prevention training. </p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">How will this affect you?</button>
        <div class="content">
        <p>I will constantly make sure that I am adopting cybersecurity best practices throughout my daily life to minimize any potential breaches to my important accounts and information. Ensuring that security updates to my operating system and software are done periodically. Using a password manager and unique passwords for each individual account/system. Enabling multi-factor authentication where possible. </p>
        <p>I also would be looking out for my family and friends who may be vulnerable by simply not knowing how, or not knowing the significance of having a strong cybersecurity posture. Recommending the above-mentioned good security practices that can be employed to prevent any disasters from occurring.</p>
        <p>Not much would be different for me, other than constantly adapting to best cybersecurity practices at the time they are implemented. The most important difference for me is that as an IT professional aware of the issues that can come about with poor cybersecurity, it is important to keep our fellow vulnerable population aware of the consequences and solutions. Not only can a breach be devastating for the individual themselves, it can also ripple into our lives directly while the attacker is looking to move laterally.</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>Increased data availability has enabled machine learning systems to be taught on a huge pool of instances, while increased computer processing power has aided these systems' analytical skills. Algorithmic breakthroughs within the discipline have also increased the power of machine learning. As a result of these advancements, systems that performed dramatically below-human levels only a few years ago can now surpass humans in a range of specialised processes.</p>
          <p>Every day, many individuals engage with machine learning-based systems - such as image recognition systems used on social media. As the science progresses, machine learning holds promise of enabling potentially transformational advancements in a variety of fields, with important social and economic implications. Currently, machine learning is being used in healthcare to develop algorithms that can assist doctors in making a more accurate diagnosis for a certain condition/disease. Also, it is assisting in the development of self-driving vehicles and in making current transportation networks more efficient.</p>
          <p>The global machine learning market size is expected to grow $20 billion by 2025, according to Fortune Business Insights. Furthermore, the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused machine learning technologies to exhibit a higher rate of growth - with the market increasing 36.1% from 2019 to 2020, according to Fortune Business Insights.</p>
          <p>Future of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the next 5 years:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Numerous advancements will occur as a result of deep learning (supervised, unsupervised, and learning through reinforcement).</li>
            <li>Gains in machine learning performance due to greater data availability and the exponential growth of computer power.</li>
            <li>AI systems will be used in real-world applications a lot more, such as healthcare, industry, banking, and transport.</li>
            <li>In the field of reinforcement learning, substantial work will be done to include ethical considerations into algorithms by rewarding outcomes that align with human ideals/values.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In order for the sector to progress governments need to create a data environment to support machine learning. This is because machine learning algorithms process and learn directly from large amounts of data to make data-driven discissions and output an array of recommendations. Governments throughout the world should improve the availability and, in conjunction usability, of public sector data whilst understanding the value of strategic datasets. Also, when researchers design their studies, they must consider the future potential uses of personal data and incorporate consents that are both ethically and socially acceptable to participants. Furthermore, governments must ensure that the key concepts of machine learning are taught to students who will be citizens, users, and developers. The ethical as well as social implications of machine learning should also be taught. Machine learning should be seen as a critical technology, one that holds great promise for a large range of sectors. Machine learning has the potential to enhance productivity, deliver more effective public services, and generate new products suited directly to individuals.</p>
          <p>When technologies such as quantum computing arise in the future, machine learning will have an enormous role to play. The incorporation of quantum computing into machine learning will lead to instant processing and rapid learning of large data sets. Moreover, open-source frameworks (such as Keras, PyTorch, and Tensorflow) are currently creating an online environment where fully automated and self-learning systems can thrive and adapt.</p>

        <button class="collapsible">What is the likely impact?</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Machine learning, AI, and automation will have a huge impact on employment and economic sectors. Technological breakthroughs can have an impact on employment in two ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Directly displace employees from the tasks they previously performed - ‘displacement effect’.</li>
            <li>Raising demand for labour in sectors that grow as a result of technological developments - ‘productivity effect’.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The use of machine learning to simplify workflows and procedures will result in the exit of many workers in a variety of industries - such as manufacturing and customer service. According to McKinsey Global Institute’s two-year study, machine learning technologies could replace up to 30% of the world’s present human workforce by 2030. The reasons why AI and machine learning technologies will replace some jobs are listed below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Computers make fewer mistakes than humans.</li>
            <li>Machine learning systems can operate 24/7, executing repetitive tasks with precision.</li>
            <li>Dangerous tasks can be performed by AI-enabled machines. This change will make manufacturing processes more efficient and keep workers out of harms way. Product creation, predictive maintenance, logistics optimization, and robotics are all areas where machine learning may be used in manufacturing.</li>
            <li>According to the APA, while the initial cost of developing and training an AI system is significant, the total cost of operation is substantially lower than hiring a human to do the same task.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The World Economic Forum stated that 85 million jobs worldwide will be replaced by machine learning technologies before 2025. However, even though AI will initially replace jobs outright it will also create new jobs. According to a World Economic Forum research, machine learning technologies will generate 97 million new jobs by 2025. The reasons why AI and machine learning technologies can’t replace all jobs are listed below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Humans are great creative thinkers and problem-solvers.</li>
            <li>Computers are incapable of simulating human interaction and, as such, can’t replace teachers, nurses, and therapists.</li>
            <li>Machine learning technologies are currently unable to perform jobs that are very complex/strategic (e.g., business leaders).</li>
            <li>Machines will need to be updated and replaced by programmers. There will always be someone who create the AI programs themselves.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Relating back to the economic effects of machine learning, the McKinsey Global Institute estimates that AI has the potential to add $13 trillion to the global economic output by 2030. Overall, the implication of AI into society will impact our lives in almost every aspect.<p>

        <button class="collapsible">How will this affect you?</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Even though it wasn’t obvious at first, after doing some research I now have a clearer understanding of the affects AI has on my personal and professional life. As a social media user, I’m constantly bombarded by online AI-powered ads that are tailored specifically to my personal interests. Social media platforms such as Facebook use ad algorithms to analyse my online behaviour to understand how likely I am to take a target action (e.g., visiting a website, viewing a product, signing up, etc). Another way AI is used online is in search engines to create ranking algorithms. My parents currently pay Google to advertise their business on the first page of a web search. Their online business is also ranked based on how original, reputable, and relevant its content is. I currently work as a courier driver for my parents’ business, delivering products throughout Sydney using Google Maps. Navigation apps (like Google Maps) use machine learning to automatically update real-world road information (such as heavy traffic and road construction) allowing me to have an accurate prediction of the time until the destination.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, my uncle owns a Tesla which he uses to drive me to work every now and then. At times he will use the Tesla’s auto-pilot system which utilizes a machine learning algorithm to provide self-driving capabilities. This feature enhances safety and reduces the workload of the driver. As machine learning becomes more prevalent in my life, I will need to reconsider my employment and gain the skills required to thrive in a future where machine learning technologies are omnipresent. Currently there are members of my family that work in manufacturing industries. As such, some of my family members may lose their jobs due to advanced robots (which are driven by AI).</p>
