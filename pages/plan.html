      <h1>Roll Marker</h1>
      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>Roll Marker will be the one stop shop for marking and exporting roll data for schools. Any information that you would ever need or want about student attendance, whether you are looking for who was at school for that day, yesterday or everyday they have ever been in school. If you need to know student attendance, this is the product for you.</p>
      <button class="collapsible">Overview</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>With the rapid advancement of technological need due to the pandemic and a need for real IT solutions in the Education sector, we plan to create Roll Marker: a system to mark attendance, review this data, and then subsequently see trends in students across not only individual schools, but across the whole country. Information would be kept on a school-by-school basis, which could then have all personal information retracted and be sent to the Education Department to then extrapolate this information, giving a broader insight into student attendance trends and where certain schools may need help (i.e. funding) to help increase attendance.</p>
        <p>To achieve this this, the team will work in various roles at different stages of the project as outlined later in this report. Through the creation of the project there will also need to be outside assistance sought, such as speaking with the Education Department to ensure all laws are being adhered to. By the end of this project, we aim to create a fully functional Roll Marker system that can be deployed Australia wide. One that not only offers a an easy to use, reliable attendance marking system, but also provides reliable security of students’ data and complies with each states Education Department laws and policies.</p>
        <p>With the constant growth of schools throughout Australia, being able to track student attendance becomes a greater task year on year. With the creation of Roll Marker, we plan to ease this burden for not only schools, but also for the entire Education sector by giving insight into the data of student attendance. This will help overworked teachers have one thing less to stress about, and as an application, can be accessed from home in the advent of schools not being ‘students-in-chairs’ as we have seen over the last 2 years of the pandemic. There is also the motivation to gather this information so a broader look at attendance can help schools see where there is opportunity for change.</p>
        <p>Following recent trends in Education of moving everything to technology-based systems, Roll Marker would be able to utilise one of the biggest IT buzz words of the time, cloud computing. Not only can this provide greater security for students’ data, but it is also great way for the project team to show future employers their use of a cloud-based skill set.</p>
        <p>Similar applications to the Roll Marker app do already exist, but one of the continuous setbacks of these applications is the pricing and the design. Many have what some would consider to a complicated user interface, functioning more like a spreadsheet doc than an actual application. What we want to provide is an easy program that any teacher can pick up and use without them needing to contact and expert or an IT department. The other benefit our application would bring would be that is Australian made for Australian schools. In collaboration with various states education departments, it would set it apart from any overseas model as our application would specifically adhere to required laws and practices throughout Australia.</p>

        <h4>Aims</h4>
        <p>The main aim of the project is to increase efficiencies and decrease workload across the sector for teachers and education staff Australia wide. By providing an application that simplifies a daily task and then makes it something that is easily referenced, we aim to cut down administration time for teachers and make it easier for schools to track an overall trend in student attendance. It will also be a one stop shop for teachers to access things like emergency contact information so if a student is unexpectedly absent or is having an emergency while in school, it is easy for them to contact the appropriate people. While the creation and distribution of the product is the main goal, there are further stretch goals that time permitting, ideally would be incorporated into the development of program.</p>
        <p>Our primary goal once the application has been created would be to trial the program with either select teachers, or a select group of schools. While labelled as a goal, it is almost certainly part of the main actions for the project as beta testing allows the team to receive feedback from real life education staff and then make improvements upon the program. We would survey participants to get their opinions on things like the user interface, if there any missing or redundant functions, and overall if they have any grievances with the application. Following this feedback, we would then implement what is feasible and anything that was out of reach for the timeframe would be put on the back burner, potentially for 2.0 update to the application.</p>
        <p>The secondary goal would be to explore further functionality for the program, taking it from simply roll marking software to something more robust and useful in an education environment. Features that could be added would cross many grades in schools. For younger classes, a virtual chore chart could be added, such as for when a Grade 1 class has an art day and needs to wipe down tables and wash brushes, moving forward into older grades, such as year 12 where it could track things such as test results, grade point average, exam results, and even have a feature to predict with information given how the student will grade at the end of the year, so if someone were to be headed in the wrong direction, a teacher could address it and help the student succeed.</p>

        <h4>Roles</h4>
        <p>The roles of each Cloud 11 team member will change throughout the project. For Sprint 1 in the opening week of the project Jack, Kurt, Mason, Marco and Jay will take on a mixture of Project Management and Business Analyst roles as we scope, plan and map out the Roll Marker project. Matthew will be seconded out for a week to work on Assessment Task 5, drawing on his experience operating as a Script Writer to prepare the draft script and storyboards for our project presentation. Moving into the second week Jack, Kurt, Marco and Jay will pivot to work more as Backend Developers as we use our newly learned skills in object-oriented programming to build out the backend classes in Python. Mason will turn his attention to the front-end wire frames operating as a Frontend Developer and Matthew will be focusing on the user experience in the role of a UX Developer ensuring that the end user remains at the centre of the Roll Marker program. In Course Week 13 we wrap up Sprint 1 and all 6 team members switch to Web Developer roles as we compile our project artefacts and reports and write, commit and publish it to our team website.</p>
        <p>Moving through to the Hypothetical Week 14-16 the team will take part in a Sprint Retro to review Sprint 1 and prepare for Sprint 2. Jack and Jay will return their focus back to Backend Developers as we build out additional modules in Python. Mason will again work as a Frontend Developer and Matthew will again focus on the user experience in the role of a UX Developer. Kurt will turn his focus to data security working as Security Analyst and Marco will focus on network solutions for the Roll Marker program working as a Cloud Engineer.</p>
        <p>In Hypothetical Week 17-19 the team will take part in a Sprint Retro to review Sprint 2 and prepare for Sprint 3. At this stage all rolls will continue as they were in Sprint 2 unless the Sprint Retro unearthed need for change.</p>
        <p>In Hypothetical Week 20-22 the team will take part in a Sprint Retro to review Sprint 3 and prepare for Sprint 4. At this stage all rolls will continue as they were in Sprint 2 unless the Sprint Retro unearthed need for change.</p>
        <p>In Hypothetical Week 23 the team take part in a project review.</p>
        <h4>Scope and Limits</h4>
        <p>Our Cloud 11 team consists of six IT professionals that are ready to develop revolutionary SaaS applications. Teachers throughout Australia need a simple, easy-to-use tool to improve and streamline the attendance tracking process. Our developers at Cloud 11 aim to produce an attendance tracking application called Roll Marker. Using the tool, teachers will be able to swiftly add and analyse student attendance data, allowing them to return to the crucial business of teaching their class.</p>
        <p>The UX design team will produce wireframes and screen deigns of the Roll Marker application using Adobe XD. These wireframes don’t have to be complex; they are only meant to show the structure and functionality of the website we are building. Once the initial wireframes are produced (this should be done in black and white), our design team will create a graphical interface to communicate visual design aspects such as colour and imagery. Furthermore, the design team will also need to create a website flowchart to map out the structure and complexity of the proposed website. After frontend development is complete, our backend developers will build out a functional Roll Marker program in Python – referring to the newly created screen designs. This program will only feature a menu that allows the user to add and view student attendance data. The purpose of the program will be to capture design concepts and test the overall user experience.</p>
        <p>Our design team will not make modifications or additions to product features once the concept has been defined and the features have been finalized. The screen designs made using Adobe XD should be kept simple, and place greater emphasis on the structure of the website as opposed to visual elements. Furthermore, we will not create a functioning website for this project, since creating and delivering a professional website may take five to six months.</p>

      <button class="collapsible">Testing</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>When releasing a product it is in uttermost care to test a product thoroughly and not leave to the final days prior to releasing a product for sale. The steps when creating Roll Marker that we at Cloud 11 will be using are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unit testing is used to ensure individual processes or the smallest testable parts of the project that are within the backend portion of the application are operating with the front end of the product correctly.</li>
          <li>UI testing where the user will be interacting with the Roll Marker inputting their records, displaying records, this needs to have a clear indication and the testing aids in ensuring we have an excellent user experience with our Roll Marker. As displaying these records will not only be done via our initial product as we plan on developing mobile access and in doing so we need to ensure the scaling of the product works correctly on each different type of aspect ratio which is another reason why UI testing is of uttermost importance. Electing to use the Sentry.io an open source project to aid in finding bugs and fix crashes in real time, while also boosting the efficiency and user experience.</li>
          <li>Automation testing will be used through the Selenium Automation tool. As we are developing on DJANGO Framework of PYTHON this is the go to automation tool when testing our product. It will automatically test the application upon executing our scripts to test things like: data input, buttons, links, responses — in short it is designed to test every element of our product automatically which can assist in speeding up the testing process.</li>
          <li>Hand testing the staff at Cloud 11 will also be creating mock up entries when the alpha version of the product has been developed. They are able to represent multiple teachers' entries as they can be given multiple user accounts to access the product as if they were a different teacher, as not every member of Cloud 11 is a developer this is a great method to test our product.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are the core testing methods our development team at Cloud 11 will be implementing while developing our Roll Marker. As this testing will be ongoing throughout the creation and when the alpha version of the product is released we will be able to use the automation in large scale to replicate test users. In case the automation testing fails we will be using the hand testing ourselves to be a backup testing process. This saves countless hours and doesn’t rely on outside sources actually testing a product correctly as there can be issues of users failing to comply with test requests. Once the testing has completed and we cannot identify any issues in operation and security it will be safe to release the product to market.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>Cloud 11 will communicate primarily through a weekly meeting in Teams, at a time that is negotiated to be most acceptable for all to be in attendance. The Teams meetings will utilize audio and video so that we can create a more personal atmosphere, as if we were conducting the meetings in person. As we have multiple people with a strong leadership drive, the person leading the meetings will be rotated weekly, with the chair also being responsible for setting the base agenda, always taking further input from other group members. From the meetings, there will be actionable tasks to keep the project moving forward with accountability clearly set for one another. </p>
    		<p>Teams chat is also encouraged daily for an informal yet active platform to keep tabs on one another, share ideas, and ask questions. Although the chat is welcomed, the channels will be a preferred method of engagement particularly for on-topic discussion, polls, file sharing, meeting schedules and a snap-in Kanban board. The Kanban board will be an integral part of understanding where each team member is at any given time with the tasks, as well as organizing and delegating the tasks in a clean, professional, and easily identifiable manner. This process allows not only for accountability but is a very good tool for tracking what needs to be done in the project.</p>
