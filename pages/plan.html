      <h1>Roll Marker</h1>
      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>Roll Marker will be the one stop shop for marking and exporting roll data for schools. Any information that you would ever need or want about student attendance, whether you are looking for who was at school for that day, yesterday or everyday they have ever been in school. If you need to know student attendance, this is the product for you.</p>

      <button class="collapsible">Overview</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>With the rapid advancement of technological need due to the pandemic and a need for real IT solutions in the Education sector, we plan to create Roll Marker: a system to mark attendance, review this data, and then subsequently see trends in students across not only individual schools, but across the whole country. Information would be kept on a school-by-school basis, which could then have all personal information retracted and be sent to the Education Department to then extrapolate this information, giving a broader insight into student attendance trends and where certain schools may need help (i.e. funding) to help increase attendance.</p>
        <p>To achieve this this, the team will work in various roles at different stages of the project as outlined later in this report. Through the creation of the project there will also need to be outside assistance sought, such as speaking with the Education Department to ensure all laws are being adhered to. By the end of this project, we aim to create a fully functional Roll Marker system that can be deployed Australia wide. One that not only offers a an easy to use, reliable attendance marking system, but also provides reliable security of students’ data and complies with each states Education Department laws and policies.</p>
        <p>With the constant growth of schools throughout Australia, being able to track student attendance becomes a greater task year on year. With the creation of Roll Marker, we plan to ease this burden for not only schools, but also for the entire Education sector by giving insight into the data of student attendance. This will help overworked teachers have one thing less to stress about, and as an application, can be accessed from home in the advent of schools not being ‘students-in-chairs’ as we have seen over the last 2 years of the pandemic. There is also the motivation to gather this information so a broader look at attendance can help schools see where there is opportunity for change.</p>
        <p>Following recent trends in Education of moving everything to technology-based systems, Roll Marker would be able to utilise one of the biggest IT buzz words of the time, cloud computing. Not only can this provide greater security for students’ data, but it is also great way for the project team to show future employers their use of a cloud-based skill set.</p>
        <p>Similar applications to the Roll Marker app do already exist, but one of the continuous setbacks of these applications is the pricing and the design. Many have what some would consider to a complicated user interface, functioning more like a spreadsheet doc than an actual application. What we want to provide is an easy program that any teacher can pick up and use without them needing to contact and expert or an IT department. The other benefit our application would bring would be that is Australian made for Australian schools. In collaboration with various states education departments, it would set it apart from any overseas model as our application would specifically adhere to required laws and practices throughout Australia.</p>

        <h4>Aims</h4>
        <p>The main aim of the project is to increase efficiencies and decrease workload across the sector for teachers and education staff Australia wide. By providing an application that simplifies a daily task and then makes it something that is easily referenced, we aim to cut down administration time for teachers and make it easier for schools to track an overall trend in student attendance. It will also be a one stop shop for teachers to access things like emergency contact information so if a student is unexpectedly absent or is having an emergency while in school, it is easy for them to contact the appropriate people. While the creation and distribution of the product is the main goal, there are further stretch goals that time permitting, ideally would be incorporated into the development of program.</p>
        <p>Our primary goal once the application has been created would be to trial the program with either select teachers, or a select group of schools. While labelled as a goal, it is almost certainly part of the main actions for the project as beta testing allows the team to receive feedback from real life education staff and then make improvements upon the program. We would survey participants to get their opinions on things like the user interface, if there any missing or redundant functions, and overall if they have any grievances with the application. Following this feedback, we would then implement what is feasible and anything that was out of reach for the timeframe would be put on the back burner, potentially for 2.0 update to the application.</p>
        <p>The secondary goal would be to explore further functionality for the program, taking it from simply roll marking software to something more robust and useful in an education environment. Features that could be added would cross many grades in schools. For younger classes, a virtual chore chart could be added, such as for when a Grade 1 class has an art day and needs to wipe down tables and wash brushes, moving forward into older grades, such as year 12 where it could track things such as test results, grade point average, exam results, and even have a feature to predict with information given how the student will grade at the end of the year, so if someone were to be headed in the wrong direction, a teacher could address it and help the student succeed.</p>
        <h4>Plans and Progress</h4>
        <h5>Concept</h5>
        <p>The development of information technology has led to an insurgence in Software as a Service (SaaS) opportunities. With the growing number of schools throughout Australia, each with hundreds if not thousands of students, teachers need to transition from physical roll marking to digital attendance trackers. Our Cloud 11 team view this as a great opportunity to develop an online service that specialises in tracking student attendance. Today the role of a teacher is challenging. Roll Marker has been designed to provide easy-to-use tools for managing student attendance, for primary and secondary schools across Australia. The service will also allow teachers to quickly analyse and export student data, helping them get back to the important task of teaching their class.</p>
        <p>The project will require the services of a team of developers that could cover frontend and backend development. Our Cloud 11 team has the necessary skills to successfully make the Roll Marker application. The roles of each team member are listed below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Full-Stack Developer</b> – Jay Westfold</li>
          <li><b>Frontend Developer</b> – Mason Jeffrey</li>
          <li><b>UX Developer</b> – Jack Coutts</li>
          <li><b>Cyber Security Analyst</b> - Kurt Harker</li>
          <li><b>Cloud Engineer</b> – Marco-Antonio Parra</li>
          <li><b>Liaison Officer</b> – Mathew Hayduk</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Plan</h5>
        <p><img src="../images\project_plan_gant_chart.png" alt="Project Plan Gant Chart"></p>
        <p>In order to streamline the process of developing Roll Marker we have setup a hypothetical 12-week time action plan. The ‘Concept Development’ stage will take roughly 4 weeks to complete. From our previous assessment task, we already had a broad idea of the Roll Marker application and what it would be used for. Throughout this period our team will conduct extensive market research to understand the roll marking challenges of teachers and clarify if our idea solves them. We will also do a competitor analysis on the applications that are like ours and are already being used by our target audience. Whilst analysing our competitors, we will try to identify the shortcomings of their applications and find new ways to improve our own online service. The ‘System Design’ stage will take around 8 weeks to develop the UX experience and code the frontend as well as backend environments. Mason and Mathew will design some wireframes of the platform and then begin refining the design. On the other hand, Jay, Jack, and Kurt will apply their newly learned programming skills to create some backend frameworks for the application using Python. After they develop the backend classes, they will be turning the wireframes into code, developing the frontend experience. The rest of the stages will take a shorter amount of time to complete as our team will be able to change roles and work cohesively together. After will launch Roll Marker, some team members will have to monitor the application for user feedback and to resolve problems.</p>
        <h5>Progress</h5>
        <p>The prototyping stage of Roll Marker progressed very slowly at first as we needed to make decisions about which features to include. The frontend user interface for Roll Marker will be a web application, with the user supplied data being stored in an SQL database. Because the application is used solely by teachers, it will not provide mass data import capabilities, instead focusing on offering a service that can simply handle user inputs.</p>

        <p><img src="../images\core_functionality_key_benefits.jpg" alt="Table of Core Functionality"></p>
        <p>Figure 2 – <i>Table listing the numerous features of the service and their associated benefits. </i></p>
        <p><img src="../images\features_and_benefits.jpg" alt="Table of Features and Benefits"></p>
        <p>After a week of finalizing the key features of the project, our user interface designers, Mason and Mathew, began creating wireframes of the platform which provided a clear overview of the page structure, layout, flow, and functionality. During this phase, the designers also tested the scope of the product, collaborated on ideas, and identified the businesses requirements.</p>
        <p>Our designers then began building on the next, more thorough iteration of the product’s design using feedback from other members of the team. In the second prototyping stage, they used Adobe XD to create screen designs and interactions for an enhanced user experience. They intended to make a user-friendly graphical interface that includes student profiles and colour coded pins to easily identify absences. The frontend user interface will have a home page and pages for taking attendance, managing classes, viewing students, and storing contacts as well as a page for the admin interface (only visible to admin staff). Designing the frontend interface using Adobe XD streamlined the prototyping stage as Mason was able to share his designs directly with the team’s backend developers.</p>
        <p>Jay, Jack, and Kurt coded a simple menu-driven program to depict the key features and functions of the Roll Marker application. The program allows schoolteachers to add student attendance data to a database containing student records via an interactive menu. All the information is contained in a CSV file. The menu also allows to teacher to view the database which is helpful when evaluating student attendance trends. The overall menu experience is user friendly and functional. Furthermore, to make the menu-driven program more dynamic the backend developers incorporated exception handling and error prompts.</p>

        <h4>Roles</h4>
        <p>The roles of each Cloud 11 team member will change throughout the project. For Sprint 1 in the opening week of the project Jack, Kurt, Mason, Marco and Jay will take on a mixture of Project Management and Business Analyst roles as we scope, plan and map out the Roll Marker project. Matthew will be seconded out for a week to work on Assessment Task 5, drawing on his experience operating as a Script Writer to prepare the draft script and storyboards for our project presentation. Moving into the second week Jack, Kurt, Marco and Jay will pivot to work more as Backend Developers as we use our newly learned skills in object-oriented programming to build out the backend classes in Python. Mason will turn his attention to the front-end wire frames operating as a Frontend Developer and Matthew will be focusing on the user experience in the role of a UX Developer ensuring that the end user remains at the centre of the Roll Marker program. In Course Week 13 we wrap up Sprint 1 and all 6 team members switch to Web Developer roles as we compile our project artefacts and reports and write, commit and publish it to our team website.</p>
        <p>Moving through to the Hypothetical Week 14-16 the team will take part in a Sprint Retro to review Sprint 1 and prepare for Sprint 2. Jack and Jay will return their focus back to Backend Developers as we build out additional modules in Python. Mason will again work as a Frontend Developer and Matthew will again focus on the user experience in the role of a UX Developer. Kurt will turn his focus to data security working as Security Analyst and Marco will focus on network solutions for the Roll Marker program working as a Cloud Engineer.</p>
        <p>In Hypothetical Week 17-19 the team will take part in a Sprint Retro to review Sprint 2 and prepare for Sprint 3. At this stage all rolls will continue as they were in Sprint 2 unless the Sprint Retro unearthed need for change.</p>
        <p>In Hypothetical Week 20-22 the team will take part in a Sprint Retro to review Sprint 3 and prepare for Sprint 4. At this stage all rolls will continue as they were in Sprint 2 unless the Sprint Retro unearthed need for change.</p>
        <p>In Hypothetical Week 23 the team take part in a project review.</p>
        <h4>Scope and Limits</h4>
        <p>Our Cloud 11 team consists of six IT professionals that are ready to develop revolutionary SaaS applications. Teachers throughout Australia need a simple, easy-to-use tool to improve and streamline the attendance tracking process. Our developers at Cloud 11 aim to produce an attendance tracking application called Roll Marker. Using the tool, teachers will be able to swiftly add and analyse student attendance data, allowing them to return to the crucial business of teaching their class.</p>
        <p>The UX design team will produce wireframes and screen deigns of the Roll Marker application using Adobe XD. These wireframes don’t have to be complex; they are only meant to show the structure and functionality of the website we are building. Once the initial wireframes are produced (this should be done in black and white), our design team will create a graphical interface to communicate visual design aspects such as colour and imagery. Furthermore, the design team will also need to create a website flowchart to map out the structure and complexity of the proposed website. After frontend development is complete, our backend developers will build out a functional Roll Marker program in Python – referring to the newly created screen designs. This program will only feature a menu that allows the user to add and view student attendance data. The purpose of the program will be to capture design concepts and test the overall user experience.</p>
        <p>Our design team will not make modifications or additions to product features once the concept has been defined and the features have been finalized. The screen designs made using Adobe XD should be kept simple, and place greater emphasis on the structure of the website as opposed to visual elements. Furthermore, we will not create a functioning website for this project, since creating and delivering a professional website may take five to six months.</p>

        <p>The Roll Marker required tools and technologies, and will be operating using the Microsoft 365 suite. This is a standard suite used by many businesses and given the low cost of the suite, along with many of the benefits it gives it is a suite we have opted to use to run our daily operations outside of development.</p>
        <p>In the creation process prior to development will be using the software Adobe XD and InVision. Adobe XD does require us to purchase a licence to operate using their software, while InVision is completely free. These are creative tools to assist with visualisation and creation of the Roll Marker’s software artefacts. Mason has had years experience using this software to develop other UI and UX designs, artefacts and templates before starting the creation process of an application.</p>
        <p>The development of the project will be using a substantial amount of software. As we are developing the Roll Marker using Python, specifically developing on the DJANGO Framework. Electing to develop our project using python and IDE is required, we have elected to use PyCharm Professional as it provides the most support for development such as HTML, JS, SQL on top of the Web Python development, this IDE also supports the use of the framework the Roll Marker is being developed upon. As all of the team members at Cloud 11 have experience developing projects in Python this was another factor as to why we chose it as the programming language. The DJANGO framework is slightly different to using python as it is primarily for full-stack web development and Kurt has had prior experience developing other web applications using it.</p>
        <p>While developing the project to constantly test code through unit testing and automation testing the Selenium automation tool and Sentry.io have been installed to our developers computers. These tools are completely free and Matthew has had experience using these testing tools which eliminates the learning curve of trying something else.</p>
        <p>Server hosting is a requirement of the Roll Marker project and Microsoft Azure provides one of the most affordable business server hosting there is. When using Azure for a server host it is in our best interest to keep things within the Azure family and use their Azure Resource Manager and Azure Data Studio, to operate and manage our SQL database and servers.</p>

        <p>When releasing a product it is in uttermost care to test a product thoroughly and not leave to the final days prior to releasing a product for sale. The steps when creating Roll Marker that we at Cloud 11 will be using are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unit testing is used to ensure individual processes or the smallest testable parts of the project that are within the backend portion of the application are operating with the front end of the product correctly.</li>
          <li>UI testing where the user will be interacting with the Roll Marker inputting their records, displaying records, this needs to have a clear indication and the testing aids in ensuring we have an excellent user experience with our Roll Marker. As displaying these records will not only be done via our initial product as we plan on developing mobile access and in doing so we need to ensure the scaling of the product works correctly on each different type of aspect ratio which is another reason why UI testing is of uttermost importance. Electing to use the Sentry.io an open source project to aid in finding bugs and fix crashes in real time, while also boosting the efficiency and user experience.</li>
          <li>Automation testing will be used through the Selenium Automation tool. As we are developing on DJANGO Framework of PYTHON this is the go to automation tool when testing our product. It will automatically test the application upon executing our scripts to test things like: data input, buttons, links, responses — in short it is designed to test every element of our product automatically which can assist in speeding up the testing process.</li>
          <li>Hand testing the staff at Cloud 11 will also be creating mock up entries when the alpha version of the product has been developed. They are able to represent multiple teachers' entries as they can be given multiple user accounts to access the product as if they were a different teacher, as not every member of Cloud 11 is a developer this is a great method to test our product.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are the core testing methods our development team at Cloud 11 will be implementing while developing our Roll Marker. As this testing will be ongoing throughout the creation and when the alpha version of the product is released we will be able to use the automation in large scale to replicate test users. In case the automation testing fails we will be using the hand testing ourselves to be a backup testing process. This saves countless hours and doesn’t rely on outside sources actually testing a product correctly as there can be issues of users failing to comply with test requests. Once the testing has completed and we cannot identify any issues in operation and security it will be safe to release the product to market.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>When developing a project a team can encounter risks far beyond your typical computer breaking down, health or family issues within the company and even institutional or governance changes. At Cloud 11 we have implemented a risk management plan for our project Roll Marker, this will ensure we as a company will produce a product that is well received and used for years to come.</p>
        <h4>Development and Software risks:</h4>
        <p>Code issues can arise if thorough testing has not been done throughout the process of developing our Roll Marker project. Through using unit testing for every code block that is testable, i.e) Taking a user input and storing it into a database as index 0, rinse and repeat. This would clarify as a unit testing when testing this code prior to release. On top of unit testing using the automation tool selenium can automatically test the project thoroughly through scripts we create, acting as if they are different users. This method of debugging is not only efficient but also cost effective as we don't need to release multiple versions for testing, or pay other people to test the product.</p>
        <p><b>Selenium Automation Tool</b>, relying on this alone can create a risk due to our limited experience in using the tool to automate testing of the product. A small oversight in not writing the automation scripts correctly could incorrectly test our project throughout creation and create more problems than it fixes. Insight of this using the automation tool only after doing thorough unit testing and human testing (other people within the Cloud 11 office) then we will rely on selenium to test at larger scales.</p>
        <p><b>Performance issues</b> can always be a factor when dealing with large databases due to the hardware the user is operating on being out-dated. With using the roll marker being developed using DJANGO framework the ability to optimise the project is relatively easy and with the use of its built in DJANGO-debug-tool it can also assist with testing and figuring out how long it takes to process blocks of code, including the SQL queries the page is generating.</p>
        <p><b>Azure Data Studio and Azure Resource Manager</b> are both used in conjunction with our Azure servers that will host our project and clients information. As a lot of the hosting of the project is reliant on using these so not understanding how to fix deployment errors or validation errors can create major problems with the final working product.</p>
        <h4>Hardware risks:</h4>
        <p><b>Server hosting</b>, especially using a third party to host the servers, can always come with risk. Selecting to go with Microsoft Azure servers is our safest option for stability. "Azure active service level agreements are 99.9%; this means they guarantee the most their servers will be down is 8.77 hours per year, or 43.83 minutes per month."</p>
        <h4>Privacy risks:</h4>
        <p><b>Student and school information</b> must be well protected and not sold to third party companies. Using Azure web services will protect our clients data and information with their cloud security, as well as only allowing certain employees access to the product and sensitive information.</p>
        <h4>Other considerations:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Project team members leaving</li>
          <li>Project team members taking holidays/vacation time off</li>
          <li>External risks</li>
          <li>Vendor management</li>
          <li>Project Control and Tracking </li>
          <li>Performance risks</li>
          <li>Governance Risks</li>
          <li>Operational Risks</li>
          <li>Market risks</li>
          <li>Legal risks</li>
          <li>External Hazard risks</li>
          <li>End user engagement</li>

        <p>Cloud 11 will communicate primarily through a weekly meeting in Teams, at a time that is negotiated to be most acceptable for all to be in attendance. The Teams meetings will utilize audio and video so that we can create a more personal atmosphere, as if we were conducting the meetings in person. As we have multiple people with a strong leadership drive, the person leading the meetings will be rotated weekly, with the chair also being responsible for setting the base agenda, always taking further input from other group members. From the meetings, there will be actionable tasks to keep the project moving forward with accountability clearly set for one another. </p>
    		<p>Teams chat is also encouraged daily for an informal yet active platform to keep tabs on one another, share ideas, and ask questions. Although the chat is welcomed, the channels will be a preferred method of engagement particularly for on-topic discussion, polls, file sharing, meeting schedules and a snap-in Kanban board. The Kanban board will be an integral part of understanding where each team member is at any given time with the tasks, as well as organizing and delegating the tasks in a clean, professional, and easily identifiable manner. This process allows not only for accountability but is a very good tool for tracking what needs to be done in the project.</p>
