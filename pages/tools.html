          <p>I believe our team works and functions quite well. We are a diverse group of individuals, with a variety of backgrounds and levels of IT experience and knowledge, and we can all offer different insights into the tasks we have faced. I think as we began the process, we fairly spread out the workload amongst the 6 of us, and I have seen that when there are areas where some of us had less knowledge, others were willing and able to step in and help support.</p>
          <p>Overall, I think that we have worked well together, and this has been a positive experience for everyone. I have learnt things from the group, such as gaining more confidence in my html by seeing how others approach creating a website, or with something like GitHub, of which I am still very new, and in seeing the basic processes others followed help me understand what I needed to do.</p>

          <p>Having our group established early led us to have success in delegation of tasks, everyone knew what needed to be done by them allowing for an early start on the assignment. By utilising everyone's background, whether it was IT specific, writing, or knowledge of applications or subjects we assigned tasks fit for each person, with the support of the group collectively.</p>
          <p>Typically working as part of a team especially in a completely online one can be difficult, however every member of group Cloud 11 made an extensive effort to communicate effectively through our teams' channels, group chat and in meetings. This allowed us to collaborate on the assignment and really become a team.</p>
          <p>I appreciate working with every individual on this assignment and have learned a great deal not just from Jay and Matthew who put in the time to educate the majority of us with GitHub, HTML and CSS but also everyone who wrote about an IT technology, the clarity and level of information was astonishing, and I look forward to continuing to work with these talented individuals.</p>

          <p>Within this group, we have a broad range of abilities and personalities which have managed to work together well. I have found myself learning something new every time I work with the group. Whether that is via learning new software
            skills like Teams or increasing my writing abilities.</p>
          <p>Over the course of assessment 2, I felt that the workload was evenly distributed and more importantly, when we felt someone was given more work than expected, there was always someone offering to assist and take some of the work.</p>

          <p>I believe our group worked cohesively, designating tasks for each group member to complete. For this assignment, I contributed by completing a few tasks such as a report on the IT technology of machine learning, analysing past industry
            data, interviewing an IT professional, and assisting with project ideas. Also, I was able to help with small sections of HTML code on GitHub. From my point of view, everyone in the group made great contributions and we were all able to
            communicate well with each other on Microsoft Teams. Each group member has a range of skills and IT experience as well as knowledge to offer. It was easier than expected to delegate tasks and to work as a team online. I have gained
            insight into a wide range of IT processes and developed confidence when working with GitHub (a programming platform that I am still new to). Furthermore, whenever I had questions or work that needed checking over group members were always
            happy to help. The main challenge that we faced as a group at times, from my perspective, was finding time to meet throughout the week – as some of us work at different times and live throughout the country (in different time-zones).</p>

          <p>I am so grateful and impressed by the group I joined for this assessment. Everybody has been so active in Teams with genuine efforts to make every meeting, as well as have the meeting at a time that suits all. We were able to quickly delegate all tasks in the assessment to those who had a preference to the task as a priority, with even distribution among all. I find it difficult to say what could be improved as I believe we all had our strengths and weaknesses and were able to complement each other in our gaps.</p>
          <p>One thing that surprised me was how professional and determined everybody in this group is to see the assignment through to the end. I have learned how important solid communication is in both maintaining motivation and accountability to one another, as our individual efforts affect the result, and we were all aware of that.  I can now see how much more a group of determined people can accomplish when working together than individually, for various reasons. </p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>We have a broad range of skills and personalities amongst the six team members in Cloud 11 which has served us well. Over the course of Assessment 2 tasks have been allocated out evenly and more often than not to those best suited. We have shared chairing meetings around the group and I think the contribution from everyone on the assessment content has been relatively even. I have been pleasantly surprised by the supporting nature of our team. There has been a lot of
            gratitude and encouragement shared in our chat feeds on Teams and at our meetings. Knowledge sharing has been a key to getting our content and website completed at a good standard and also key to learning new things, even something as simple as sharing information about IT related podcasts. I have learned a lot about different ways of working amongst our team members, and how we all work at different times through the day and week, but despite those differences, we can
            still work as a high performing team. Our GitHub log shows a spread across the team, some team members were heavier on the content side of the assessment whilst others were heavier on compiling.</p>

        <h2>Group</h2>
        <p>Cloud 11 have come together as a strong unit since forming in March 2022. Consensus within the group is that we are diverse, supportive and we work well together. Our varied skills and levels of work experience compliment each other. Tasks for Assessment Task 2 were distributed evenly across the group with everyone contributing in order to complete the required outcomes. Attendance at weekly meetings was strong across the group and whenever someone could not attend, they communicated that with the team and were able to view the meeting recordings and read the actions and minutes from the meeting to catch up.</p>
        <p>Working remotely can be challenging, especially when taking into account working across different time zones, yet the team harnessed the tools available to us including Microsoft Teams and GitHub to keep communication channels open. Some team members had prior experience with using these collaborative tools and they were able to share their knowledge with the wider team.</p>
        <p>Given the short amount of time the group have worked together, the comradery and support that has developed has been a telling factor in how productive the team has been. When faced with illness or other challenging circumstances, the team banded together to support each other and get the work done. The group have learned the many benefits of working together as a team and we hope this is evident in the content we have created. We are looking forward to continuing our work together over the coming weeks for the remaining group assessments for the Introduction to IT course.</p>
