        <div class="content">
          <p>For this assignment, having just successfully completed Assignment 2, we had a strong foundation to build upon. I mean this both in a literal sense as the foundation of the project had been decided and much of the hard yards had begun, and in a more metaphorical sense in the way that as a group we had built a reliable team structure to work from. Beginning this project felt a lot less daunting than the beginning of assignment due to this fact.</p>
          <p>Along the way we assigned roles, doled out the tasks and as a group got to work on what needed to be done. Many challenges were faced along the way with work, life, and other study commitments coming up as we went, and I think as individuals, and as a group, we conquered many of these problems. Unfortunately for us, our team member Marco had to leave towards the end of our project due to the mounting pressures of these afore mentioned problems, and although we got to the end, it cannot be understated how much his work and time was appreciated while he was with us.</p>
          <p>All in all, I can say that over the course of the group work that has been part of Intro to IT I am much more confident being placed into a team with people I've only ever virtually met, and I think we very much proved that although life can get in the way, you can still rise to the challenge and achieve your goals with proper planning and great teamwork.</p>

          <p>As assignment 3 is viewed as a continuation of assignment 2, while going into a lot greater detail especially with the project we had a lot of the foundation already laid out. To get a head start on the assignment we had a meeting with all of our members quickly assigning to do tasks and with Jay’s implementation of the kanban board it was easy to manage everyone's tasks. With our previous marks being released we could analyse and see where we need to improve and what we can also do to improve our assignment.</p>
          <p>Our team's communication has always been exceptional for what I would define as a complete online learning experience which led us to great success in the past and this assignment was no exception. With Marco leaving and still communicating it to us via teams allowing us plenty of time to re-assign and pick up his tasks which myself, Mason and Jack all took charge in completing as well as our own.</p>
          <p>With GitHub being my weakest point, I chose to create the repo for the group project assignment (which is separate from the website repo). This is something I hadn’t done and it was a lot easier than I thought. Updating the website with newer information was primarily Jay, including the parts of the project I was doing which due to my boss being on leave and I was working 12 hour days I am thankful for him and the team understanding that life can get hectic at times, but without me communicating this they wouldn’t have known. With the limited time I had I wanted to focus on the project (especially given it weighs 50% this time) and revising the final drafts of the report to ensure we meet the scope to the best of our abilities.</p>
          <p>The group came together just as strong as we have in the past, and played to our strengths while learning from each other in the areas we are weaker in. This is my definition of teamwork and Cloud 11 has been the best team I have been a part of for an assignment.</p>

          <p>Over the course of the term while working in Group 11, I have found that we have only gotten better. I have always felt like a part of the team and never felt that I my voice was not being heard or appreciated. While did not play a significant role in the creation of Assessment 3, I was confident that we would be able to put the assessment together effectively and cohesively.</p>
          <p>My significant contribution was taking a major part in other assessment tasks such as assessment 5, which I was asked to put together mostly independently. This done due to my background and understanding of creative arts, and this was a perfect opportunity for me to bring out my skills to the team. Contributions to assessment 5 include the creation of the script and storyboard, as well as the editing and majority filming of the content. My team trusted me to be able to excel in this regard and it was delegated in a way that showed the best parts of all our personalities and abilities.</p>
          <p>I believe the GitHub logs was a drastic improvement from Assessment 2 to Assessment 3, I believe this was in large part due to the group's newfound knowledge of the software and how to best execute what needed to be done.</p>
          <p>The largest challenged our group faced I feel, was the initial confusion and mismanagement of time. While this was prevalent mostly in Assessment 2, I feel that with both Assessment 3 and 5 we were able to better delegate roles and knew who was expected to do what. This was in part due to the addition of the Tasks for each Assessment and subsequent assigning of those tasks to team members. This meant that we were able to see quickly and efficiently what was done and what needed to be done. I feel the workload for these tasks was fairly and approbatively split based on our individual strengths and weaknesses.</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>Reflecting over the last term of working as a team to develop our ‘Role Marker’ application, I feel that I have benefited in terms of teamwork skills and have managed to accomplish many tasks. For this assignment, I contributed by completing a few tasks such as a report on the Plans and Progress, assisting with project ideas, developing the scope, and making prototypes on Adobe XD. Our team worked cohesively throughout the term, designating tasks for each group member to complete through Microsoft Planner.</p>
          <p>Everyone in the group, in my opinion, made significant contributions, and we were all able to interact well on Microsoft Teams. Each group member brings a unique set of skills, IT expertise, and knowledge to the table. It was surprisingly easier than expected to allocate responsibilities and collaborate online as a team. I've gained knowledge of a variety of IT procedures and gained confidence when dealing with graphic design tools like Adobe XD. Furthermore, anytime I had questions or needed help with the assignment, group members were always willing to assist. This has also prepared me for future collaborative projects.</p>
          <p>One of the greatest challenges my group faced was time management and not being able to meet at times, due to other commitments. We quickly overcame this, realising that to finish the assignment properly, we would need to buckle down and improve our communication skills. Another major challenge that our team faced was losing a group member, Marco Parra, midway through the term. This added a greater workload to certain team members as they now had to complete more tasks.</p>
          <p>We all had different responsibilities for the assessment task; some group members focusing more on using GitHub (for website development) and others doing writing tasks (for the PDF report and the website). Overall, we all shared the workload throughout the term.</p>

          <p>We introduced the use of Kanban boards using Microsoft Planner, adding one to our Teams Site for the Project Plan, the Roll Marker Project and the Assessment Task 5 Presentation. This allowed us to chunk up each project, break it into tasks and allow team members to assign themselves to tasks from the backlog and move them through stages of Up Next/In Progress/Complete. This helped a lot in distributing tasks evenly and being able to track where everything was at through the assessment period.</p>
          <p>We were probably slightly delayed in getting started on the project as there was a lot of competing pressures from assessments and workloads in other courses and we all work full-time as well, so that made things difficult. In an ideal world we would be able to concentrate 100% on a project of this size, but that just wasn’t going to be realistic under the current circumstances.</p>
          <p>I was really surprised to hear that Marco was leaving us, those external pressures just became too much for him which is completely understandable but I’m really grateful for all he contributed to our team over A2, A3 and A5.</p>
          <p>We each have different skillsets and strengths and I think we took advantage of that with the tasks that we each undertook, so seeing one or two team members with more activity in GitHub is not really a huge surprise as we each took on different tasks throughout the assessment period. I think we all work really well together and I will be taking a lot of confidence away from this task with thanks to a great team of supportive people that were willing to work hard towards a common goal.</p>

        <h2>Group</h2>
        <p>Once again, Cloud 11 have come together as a strong unit since forming in March 2022. We learnt all about risk and the impact of losing team members towards the end of Assessment Task 3 (AT3) when our team member Marco had to step aside due to extenuating circumstances, but we pulled together and completed the project plan to a level that we are all quite proud of.</p>
        <p>On top of losing a valuable team member, we all had our own diversity to get through. Largely in part due to external work pressures, but also just living our everyday lives and finding time to take pauses for things like our own mental health, and even with these struggles we managed to consistently plan our meetings and action tasks to stay on top of the workload.</p>
        <p>Continuing from Assessment Task 2 (AT2), consensus within the group remains that we are diverse, supportive and we work well together. Our varied skills and levels of work experience compliment each other. Tasks were again distributed evenly across the group with everyone contributing in order to complete the required outcomes. Attendance at weekly meetings was strong across the group and whenever someone could not attend, they communicated that with the team and were able to view the meeting recordings and read the actions and minutes from the meeting to catch up.</p>
        <p>We already started to see the fruits of having worked through AT2 together, our combined skills using Teams, GitHub, Microsoft 365 and other productivity tools improved and it helped smooth out the delivery of AT3. Probably the most important new tool that was brought into play was the use of the Kanban board planning system, which allowed for planning, accountability, and at the loss of one of our members, a restructure of tasks.</p>
