        <h2 style="text-align: center">Roll Maker</h2>
        <p>Roll Marker: The one stop shop for marking and exporting roll data for schools. Any information that you would ever need or want about student attendance, whether you are looking for who was at school for that day, yesterday or everyday
          they have ever been in school. If you need to know student attendance, this is the product for you.</p>

      <button class="collapsible">Motivation</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>With over 2000 schools in Victoria, Australia alone, each with possibly hundreds or even thousands of students, schools need to know where students are. In the modern age we are moving away from physical rolls and into digital rolls; this
          allows for services that can quickly analyse and export data. I see this as a perfect opportunity to create a program that specialises in only rolls and attendance data. Data requirements from the Australian Government can cause an increase
          in the cost of production temporarily while permanently increasing the upkeep cost of the data; this allows for the increased revenue opportunities.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="collapsible">Description</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Roll Marker does everything you would expect a roll marking program to do. You are able to mark the roll effectively and quickly while being able to change the roll at any time. This information would be collected and stored for future
          reference to allow school staff to see who was there on the day or class.
          While this is the expected usage of the software, you will also be able to export attendance data from individual students, classes, year levels and even the whole school. This information can be customised to simply show the percentage
          of students attending all the way to specifying what day students are more likely to not attend class and which reasons students are not attending class most often. This would be a process that is simple for anyone to pick up and find the
          information they need while allowing for high levels of customization of what information they need. Finally, all of this information would be accessible from anywhere to allow for quick access to data with the rise of working from home.

      <div class="content">
        <p>Hardware required would be a server that holds the data that is entered by schools. Software requirements are programs that allow for extraction of entered data from the roll into the database and then from the database into data
          exports that are end-user friendly. Software would also need to be developed for staff to mark the roll and allow for that data to be editable after the information is entered to allow for later changes to a specific roll. By using
          MySQL and the Python framework Django, we will be able to quickly create a minimum viable product and build further features and functionality.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="collapsible">Skills Required</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The roll marking software and the exporting data software will need to be developed. This software will need to be capable of being accessed online and be able to update the information via the roll marking software. I can see these
          skills being accessible by a software developer that specialises in web software. As this information can be of the sensitive nature, we will also require a level of security on the database and the access to the software which has
          subsequent access to the database; this will necessitate development of login credentials and permissions to grant the access required without allowing access to the whole database.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="collapsible">Outcome</button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>If this project is successful, I can see the software expanding into other areas of data extraction that are required for schools; this can come in the form of staff clock-in and clock out as well as visitor sign-in and location
          tracking. This can create the need for additional software developers and hardware requirements as the information being collected by the system needs to be held onsite for regulation purposes.</p>
