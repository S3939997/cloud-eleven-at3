      <h1>IT Work</h1>
      <p>The IT industry is large, jobs in the industry are varied and they can change over time. Sometimes it can be difficult to form an impression of what a job is like from a job advertisement or a position description. On Thursday, April 7th, the Cloud 11 team sat down with IT professional Fida Hasan, an ICT Expert and Research Fellow at RMIT Universitys Centre for Cyber Security Research and Innovation (CCSRI) to find out more about his work in cyber security and what is typically involved in his job on a day-to-day basis.
      </p>
      <h1>Fida Hasan</h1>
      <h4>ICT Expert and Research Fellow<br>
      RMIT University Centre for Cyber Security Research and Innovation (CCSRI)</h4>
      <h5>Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do? Please tell us about the industry you work in. What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h5>
      <p>Opening our interview, Fida has said that he wears ‘many different hats’. He is not only a researcher but also a cyber security expert, with over 5 years of experience in IT business development and consulting, and over 10 years in research and academia. At present, he is a part of a team of 8 investigating data breaches across the university and government sectors. They are looking at threat intelligence and modelling, with a focus on curriculum infrastructure. In his current role he sees himself primarily as a researcher and an academic working with analytics, and although not part of his current role, he has also worked in more of a Security Operations Centre (SOC) analyst role in the past, monitoring specific threat groups. He has also lectured in ethical hacking.
      </p>
      <h5>Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals. What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h5>
  	  <p>Fida works in collaboration with government departments such as The Department of Home Affairs, Industry Partners, and with staff at other universities working towards a common understanding. Much of this interaction is about sharing knowledge and expertise across the sector to present a uniform response to the threats that the sector faces.</p>
      <p>Emerging technologies are one of the largest threats, including the increasing usage of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) in workplaces. The covid pandemic accelerated movement towards connectivity around the world much faster than was ever predicted and according to Fida, that has widened the attack window. He also noted that companies such as IBM and Microsoft have reported increased spikes since the onset of the pandemic.
      </p>
      <h5>What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? </h5>
      <p>Most of Fida’s time is spent on his primary project working towards meeting key deliverables, using an agile methodology and scrum framework, breaking up the project into sprints. He has said that most of the project work he does is captured on Trello boards and then documents are shared amongst his team using resources such as Microsoft SharePoint. A major part of his time seems to be spent on reporting information back to his colleagues.</p>
      <h5>Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h5>
      <p>As a researcher and an academic in the field of Cyber Security sometimes Fida has to go beyond the direct responsibilities of his job role. Part of that is needing to expand his network of relationships with other academics and IT professionals. When asked what area he found the most challenging in his role, Fida said that the biggest challenge he is facing at present is around resourcing. Being able to find skilled people has been hard as of late as they are hard to find and take a lot of time to train. This has further been hindered by current global conditions, with the pandemic still making movement around the world difficult.
      </p>
      <h5>Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h5>
      <p>When discussing cloud computing, Fida said ‘data is everything’. With data you do so many things, so for an organisation ensuring their staff have fast and secure access is imperative. It is also the biggest threat, in the higher education sector, to intellectual property. Research output is highly valuable and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups are continually targeting the sector.
