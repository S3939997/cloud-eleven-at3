          <p><b>Ideal Job:</b> Data Specialist<br>
          <b>Labour Market Assessment:</b> No Shortage<br>
          <b>Future Demand:</b> Moderate Future Demand</p>
          <p>Small and large businesses alike are slowly increasing the demand for data specialists to analyse data to increase efficiency within their business. Even though each business and organisation all require to have at least one data specialist within their data analysis team, this reflects why there is not as much of a shortage even though they are in demand from employers. This due to a rise in popularity for the role as majority of businesses cannot clean and visualise the data like an experienced data specialist can. This ensures their demand going forward into the future even with AI technology around the corner because this role must not only understand data, but they also need to understand the people they are working with to get the best results from presenting their data to their employers.</p>
          <h5>Why this job?</h5>
          <p><i>"This role appeals to me because I like to take time to organise things into their respective places and I take a great deal of personal and professional pride in this fact. As a government job, it also offers a lot of stability which is important as I progress my career and wish to start a family. I also have an interest in data analytics and as this role also draws on my previous experience in management, it is a position I would have some comfort going into."</i></p>
          <h5>After Burning Glass Data Analysis</h5>
          <p><i>"Although there is not a high demand for this role, it is still moderately sought after and as such my opinion has not changed. It is a role that will always be required in some form, especially approaching things like the Census. The fact that there is so much security in a government role such as thins really cements it as an ideal choice for me."</i></p>

          <p><b>Ideal Job:</b> Cyber Security Analyst<br>
          <b>Labour Market Assessment:</b> Shortage<br>
          <b>Future Demand:</b> Strong Future Demand</p>
          <p>Businesses and Organisations are becoming more aware of how important Cybersecurity is to their critical infrastructure. There is at least one cyber security analyst in a business or in some instances an entire Cybersecurity team, this creates multiple jobs for the role. Due to education requirements combined with established experience many struggle to enter the Pure-Cybersecurity space, and many get forced into hybrid jobs such as network engineer or project management which in-turn they then settle on as a career as they are highly paid regardless and do not require extensive further education and work experience. All of these are major factors of shortage in Cybersecurity jobs.</p>
          <p>With Cybersecurity already having fewer candidates than most IT jobs this only increases the demand more especially as technology evolves and we see more use of cloud computing and the Internet of Things the demand for Cybersecurity Analysts will only grow.</p>
          <h5>Why this job?</h5>
          <p><i>"he role of Senior Cyber Security Analyst is appealing to me as you are both a part of the blue and red team when it comes to protecting and serving the community or even the country. Being a part of the Cyber Security team in a hospital is a noticeably big deal as you have hundreds of lives in your hands every day, it might not seem like it, but one attack can cause great chaos, panic, and doubt within a community. This was the case throughout the pandemic in early 2020 having black hat organisations attempt to steal patient information such as social security numbers in America or using ransomware to extort them and disable systems, putting patients' lives at risk just for some examples. It does not have to be for St Vincent's Hospital but working as Cyber Security for the Government whether it be subcontracted or employed directly is the ideal job for me."</i></p>
          <h5>After Burning Glass Data Analysis</h5>
          <p><i>"Looking at this just confirms the growth and cost cyber security has cost multiple countries over a few years and it will only increase as technology and methods improve. I have spoken with a renown cyber security expert who has given me an advanced guide for my pathway into an entry level position and how to further career progression which gives me the confidence needed to pursue this as a career. AI technology is the only fear I had but upon further research and my understanding is that “hackers” can foil the AI algorithms quite easily which will increase the threat landscape."</i></p>

            <b>Future Demand:</b> Strong Future Demand</p>
          <p>The Network resides within the heart of the business, this is the digital infrastructure that keeps the everything talking to each other and has become vital to business operations in the modern era. Network administrators require to work with both hardware and software of the computers, but also people. As many other roles such as Cybersecurity or Cloud engineering require a lot of skills a Network Admin has, this becomes a steppingstone for many looking to get into those two sectors, which means many people are taught the digital building blocks to become a Network Administrator, this however does not reflect in how demand the job is.</p>
          <p>As technology develops businesses and organisations are continually investing in hardware and software that requires installation and updates on the regular. Network administrators require such a diverse skill set that not everyone can meet</p>
          <h5>Why this job</h5>
          <p><i>"This job appeals to me as Network Administrators are in control of every facet of a network, this is so if things go wrong, they can diagnose and resolve issues. The diagnoses and problem-solving aspects are what appeals to me the most."</i></p>
          <h5>After Burning Glass Data Analysis</h5>
          <p><i>"Looking at the data, it has affirmed the feeling I had that; there will always be demand for Network Administrators. This is coupled with the increasing requirement for always-online services and cloud ‘As a service’ infostructure becoming increasingly prevalent. I expect this to continue and subsequentially allow me to find a job. I expected the demand to have little to no shortage due to the necessity of a network administrator when any network is created at a business or corporate level."</i></p>

            <b>Labour Market Assessment:</b> Shortage<br>
            <b>Future Demand:</b> Moderate Future Demand</p>
          <p>To create a mobile application, you typically need an app developer but in many cases a team of app developers. Typically, an App developer would be extremely ambitious, intelligent, and possess a creative mind with wide set of technical skills to match. The combination of human skills, digital building blocks and business enablers all create a shortage in the industry.</p>
          <p>Mobile applications and the technology that uses it are forever evolving and diverse types of applications are always needed which create a high demand, going back to 2020, at the start of the pandemic applications like Zoom or Skype were in such high demand and each year there will always be someone new to be made, and not every app developer as the creativity or vision to create every type of app, that is why some specialise in games, others in business applications, some with cloud applications etc. This pushes the demand in the entire industry as not everyone wants to create every type of application</p>
          <h5>Why this job?</h5>
          <p><i>"I have always been interested in becoming an iOS developer due to the high starting salary, career flexibility, and the fact that you can work from anywhere. The iOS developer position at Servian Pty Ltd appealed to me due to my programming background and the fact that I will be building innovative software. In addition to mobile development, I will also be working on projects involving multiple technologies from Big Data and Analytics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, DevOps as well as numerous cloud technologies where I can learn, contribute, and extend my career into these technologies. The role at Servian also seems like it will be a collaborative environment which I view as appealing."</i></p>
          <h5>After Burning Glass Data Analysis</h5>
          <p><i>"After reviewing the Burning Glass data, which was captured 4 years ago, it has shown me that there is high demand for software developers. Furthermore, in recent years there has been an increase in demand for software engineers and programmers who have skills in JavaScript, project management, and graphic design. With this new knowledge my opinion of my ideal job has not changed. I will need to learn a broad range of skills (such as learning a variety of programming languages, business skills, and mobile design), however, I will also need to specialise in skills that are currently in high demand to expand my portfolio."</i></p>

          <b>Future Demand:</b> Strong Future Demand</p>
          <p>The Cloud is a fast-growing in adoption to businesses as there is clear data backing up its cost-effectiveness and business scalability. But as more businesses adopt cloud technology the demand will only grow for Cloud engineers and secure their future within the IT industry. Currently the need for a Cloud engineer is limited mostly because the cloud and the technologies they use is so new, the technical skills required to effectively engineer networks and scale business are still being learned by many, but as these technologies refine and become more mainstream, the demand for Cloud engineers to implement solutions will increase which will create a major shortage in the Cloud engineering space.</p>
          <h5>Why this job?</h5>
          <p><i>"The role appeals to me because the description of the job shows an organization who is looking to make innovative implementations to their business with platforms, I am both familiar with and enjoy using (currently at a basic level). What they are looking for is exactly what I would like to see myself doing in the future."</i></p>
          <h5>After Burning Glass Data Analysis</h5>
          <p><i>"There is no identifiable shortage of Cloud Engineers currently, but there is a strong demand in the future. With this information, alongside my interest in the cloud’s capability – I have not changed the opinion of my ideal job. Cloud Engineers require a broad range of skills such as networking, security, designing, optimizing and more – but all cloud-associated instead of the traditional sense of these disciplines. Having worked in an MSP, I have also seen first-hand the benefits that incorporating the cloud for a business can be and I believe I can make a positive difference with a healthy career continuing to do this on a much bigger scale."</i></p>

          <p>Creating strategy and implementation by analysing the existing business needs, sales targets, systems, and processes in a business is typically handled by a Senior Analyst. Businesses have been employing these type of analysts for years whether it is just for raw data, logistics, sales analysis, statistics etc. All these different analytical jobs are branched out from being a data analyst. With having lower demand for digital building blocks but relying on many human skills and business enabler skills, this role much like the others will always be in demand.</p>

      <p>When comparing a set of specific skills to what is typically in demand from employers, whilst the specific skills might be different (ie. a Data Analyst does not need to have experience in PowerShell, but a Cyber Security Analyst would) both roles require an element of Computer Programming, but they would require knowledge of a different language. This may not be the best way to compare jobs as IT specific skills are typically static when looking to work in the IT industry.</p>
      <p>If we account for every skill available in any job across IT the list can be useless especially when broken down into the specifics. However, when comparing our jobs to burning-glass analytical data, with a broader range of information, it gives us the best range of skills to compare what we need going forward into our future to reach our dream jobs.</p>
      <p>Across our group, each job would require at least 2 of the top 3 digital building blocks, but human skills and business enabler skills are all required across the jobs to be the most successful in any tech-related role.</p>

	  <h2>How Do These Skills Rank, In Terms Of Demand From Employers?</h2>
	  <p>When comparing a set of specific skills to what is typically in demand from employers, whilst the specific skills might be different (ie. a Data Analyst does not need to have experience in PowerShell, but a Cyber Security Analyst would) both roles require an element of Computer Programming, but they would require knowledge of a different language. This may not be the best way to compare jobs as IT specific skills are typically static when looking to work in the IT industry.</p>
      <p>If we account for every skill available in any job across IT the list can be useless especially when broken down into the specifics. However, when comparing our jobs to burning-glass analytical data, with a broader range of information, it gives us the best range of skills to compare what we need going forward into our future to reach our dream jobs.</p>
      <p>Across our group, each job would require at least 2 of the top 3 digital building blocks, but human skills and business enabler skills are all required across the jobs to be the most successful in any tech-related role.</p>

	    <h1>Compare And Contrast</h1>
		<h2>Skills Shared Across Our Ideal Jobs</h2>
		<button class="collapsible">Digital Building Block Skills</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Data specialists and Senior analysts share the many of the foundational skills of digital building blocks, these typically statistical programming languages and other office applications. The core programming languages used are Python, R and SQL, these allow analysts to compare data sets at a large scale with the use of algorithms and machine learning. All this raw data is useless without creating a visualisation that is easy to read and understand for their employer, this is where the use of Microsoft 365 (Excel, PowerPoint, Word), PowerBI and Salesforce come into play.</p>
          <p>Network Administrators are primarily built upon the digital building blocks of digital security, network administration and management, hardware management, system administration and virtualisation. Being a Network Administrator means to be an expert of both digital and physical infrastructure of their employer with the type of operating systems used at business. They tend to specialise in programming languages like Python, PERL, and TCL.</p>
          <p>Cloud Engineers and Cyber Security Analysts are built the same foundational skills of digital security, networking, and virtualisation but need to know not only how a network works but also be experts in their retrospective field. Cloud Engineers for instance will have a wide range of programming languages at their disposal such as .NET, Golong, PHP, Python and SQL. They also need to completely understand cloud computing and infrastructure, all the different cloud service providers such as AWS, Azure and GoogleGo, while improving their digital security skills to fit their role typically with blockchain, cloud and mobile operating system security. Cyber Security Analysts need to understand the foundations of both roles but have a more advanced knowledge of all operating systems along with a vast knowledge of programming languages like C, C++, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, and Python. Understanding a large variety of programming languages compliments the role further allowing them to work on a wide range of projects with any type of security asset.</p>
          <p>App Developers while specialising in being software developers with a passion for creation of mobile applications they still need to have a complete understanding of how to use a computer much like any other IT role as applications typically developed using these programming languages Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, Swift, C#. With the advance in windows and now being able to code with Swift (used to create iOS applications) App developers are free to use whatever device has their preferred operating system. Having a complete understanding of cloud computing, networks and operating systems allows for a lot more functionality with apps as technology is evolving customers and employers are excepting more features such as complete cross-platform capabilities, cloud storage for files or game saves and an easy-to-use user interface and better user experience.</p>
        </div>
		<button class="collapsible">Human Skills</button>
        <div class="content">
		  <p>Whether you want to be a Data Specialist, Senior Analyst, Network Administrator, Cloud Engineer, Cyber Security Analyst or even an App Developer all of these require a broad range of required skills, whether that be digital building blocks, human skills or business enabling skills. All these jobs need to well-rounded with their analytical skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Being able to analyse and think on your feet is not enough though, the ability to collaborate as part of a team and work with others either in your field, or across the room in a meeting is crucial for success in the IT industry. These all a necessity for any job, these skills ensure that the IT professional can think clearly and rationally while understanding the information they are looking at whether it be code for programming, network intrusion or statistical data, and then the ability to convey this information in an appropriate manner to team members or superiors. As if this is not enough... Any job in IT will typically have you doing more than one job at time, having skills like being able to multi-task along with organisational skills and time management are three other crucial human skills for all IT roles to have. All these human skills are the basic foundational skills anyone wanting to work in the IT industry will want to develop to the best of their ability to succeed.</p>
        </div>
		<button class="collapsible">Business Enabler Skills</button>
        <div class="content">
		  <p>Having all these flashy IT skills and human skills can be completely worthless if you do not understand how to enable them within a business or workplace setting. The primary focus of all these jobs is accomplished by understanding how to use business enabler skills such as, business analysis and processes, communication of data and digital design, project management and risk mitigation. These all assist in business for growth and improvement, with skills to analyse the companies they work for and provide tailored solutions with their skill set. As these jobs progress and you get promoted to a senior position being proficient in project management is also necessary as you will be managing projects and team members.</p>
        </div>
		<h2>What Skills Seperate IT Jobs?</h2>
		<p>Comparing the foundational skills within each group category with our desired ideal jobs at Cloud 11 match up incredibly well when comparing to job advertisements and the 2017 burning glass analysis of foundational skills information. This establishes a strong connection between skills in every IT job and even ties them with jobs outside of the IT family. These are the skills employers will primarily look for, while skills like “leadership” are very extremely valuable, they are also very role dependant, and they are just as important and the other skills, but statistically will not show on the charts for high demand.</p>
		<p>The foundation of digital building blocks separates what defines your job in an IT role. As the IT industry is full of hybrid jobs, meaning you take on more than one job at a time, the perquisite for success is to have all the human and business enabler skills mentioned above, to create deeper connections with colleagues and customers. Even though all our jobs differ in what area we want to specialise in, to get a job in an advanced IT role these skills are all a must have to succeed no matter what job you want to go into.</p>
		<h2>Hybrid Jobs, What Are They?</h2>
		<p>While the IT industry is full of tech-based jobs, all these jobs are hybrid jobs. The fact these roles require multiple skill sets and being able to do more than one job, this is what secures them as a future role going forward and only increases the demand even with the fear of future technology like job automation. Looking at studies they show 42% of jobs can be automated in the future while only 12% of hybrid jobs will truly be automated. Therefore, being able to understand of how to enable all three of these foundational skill groups is what creates your success when working in any field within the IT industry and will ensure your longevity in any role. Which is why IT professions have such a broad skillset range.</p>
