          <h2>Ideal Job: Data Specialist</h2>
          <p>The role is all about data collection and transformation by combining assorted groups of information into new data sets. This role appeals to me because I like to take time to organise things into their respective places and I take a great deal of personal and professional pride in this fact. As a government job, it also offers a lot of stability which is important as I progress my career and wish to start a family. I also have an interest in data analytics and as this role also draws on my previous experience in management, it’s a position I would have some comfort going into.

          <h2>Ideal Job: Cyber Security Analyst</h2>
          <p>Being a Senior Cyber Security Analyst you are responsible for monitoring security access, conducting security assessments through vulnerability testing and risk analysis. Required to perform both internal and external security audits.
          </p>
          <p>The role of Senior Cyber Security Analyst is appealing to me as you are both a part of the blue and red team when it comes to protecting and serving the community or even the country. Being a part of the Cyber Security team in a hospital is a very big deal as you have hundreds of lives in your hands every day, it might not seem like it but one attack can cause great chaos, panic and doubt within a community. This was definitely the case throughout the pandemic in early 2020 having blackhat organisations attempt to steal patient information such as social security numbers in America or using ransomware to extort them and disable systems, putting patients lives at risk just for some examples. It doesn't have to be for St Vincent's Hospital but working as Cyber Security for the Government whether it be subcontracted or employed directly is the ideal job for me.

          <h2>Ideal Job: Network Administrator</h2>
          <p>A Network Administrator to responsible for the installation of hardware and software that is specific to the network of a company including servers and user management software. Network Administrators are always expected to maintain the network, which includes managing user accounts and fault resolution.
          </p>
          <p>This job appeals to me as Network Administrators are in control of every facet of a network, this is so if things go wrong, they are able to diagnose and resolve issues. The diagnoses and problem-solving aspects are what appeals to me the most.

          <h2>Ideal Job: App Developer</h2>
          <p>My ideal job in the field of IT would be a mobile app developer responsible for creating applications that make life easier. I have always been interested in becoming an iOS developer due to the high starting salary, career flexibility, and the fact that you can work from anywhere. The iOS developer position at Servian Pty Ltd appealed to me due to my programming background and the fact that I will be building cutting edge software. In addition to mobile development, I will also be working on projects involving multiple technologies from Big Data and Analytics, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, DevOps as well as numerous cloud technologies where I can learn, contribute and extend my career into these technologies. The role at Servian also seems like it will be a collaborative environment which I view as appealing.

          <h2>Ideal Job: Cloud Engineer</h2>
          <p>The position is looking for a Cloud Engineer who wants to be part of an organization that is growing their presence in the cloud. Somebody who is both knowledgeable of existing, on premises systems but also strong with cloud products, services, and frameworks.
          </p>
          <p>The role appeals to me because the description of the role shows an organization who is looking to make innovative implementations to their business with platforms, I am both familiar with and enjoy using (currently at a basic level). What they are looking for is exactly what I would like to see myself doing in the future.

          <h2>Ideal Job: Senior Analyst, Strategy and Implementation</h2>
          <p>The Senior Analyst - Strategy and Implementation role is a strategic roll, analysing the existing business needs, sales targets, systems and processes currently in place, working with many stakeholders including a dedicated Salesforce CRM team, Operations and Sales Teams and designing a Sales Pipeline and Reporting function that is fit for purpose. The possibility of leading and working on a strategic systems based project from start to finish is what I find most appealing. The role has many similarities to a User Experience Developer but with a more Business based focus. From scoping out the initial needs, researching and putting together a business case and proposal and then delivering the end product is the level I would like to aim for.
