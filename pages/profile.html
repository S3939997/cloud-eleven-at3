      <h1>Team Profile</h1>
      <p>The individual results of our tests show that our personalities vary quite a lot, but as the graphs below show – the Cloud 11 group members balanced each other out. This gave us confidence that we would be able to complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses for the different requirements in the group assessment.</p>

          <p>For the MBTI results, the strongest traits in our results were our Assertiveness (identity), Judging (tactics) and Feeling (nature) traits.<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Averaging higher in assertive was comforting as it would be to our benefit as busy individuals to remain confident in our assessment challenges.</li>
              <li>Averaging higher in Judging is another great advantage as a trait which desires to be well-planned and on schedule.</li>
              <li>Averaging higher in Feeling is a big advantage as we all want each other to succeed and do well, quickly establishing trust in one another despite our boundaries being remote and in different time zones.</li>

        <article>
          <p>The Big Five personality trait results showed our group had high Openness, above average Conscientiousness, Extraversion and Agreeableness and average Neuroticism.<br>
            <ul>
              <li>High openness works well in group settings as we are individually able to bring unique perspectives to the table.</li>
              <li>Above average conscientiousness is advantageous for the group as the members are more accountable for themselves and each other.</li>
              <li>Above average extraversion is welcomed as we break straight through any discomfort or awkwardness with one another from the get-go, getting straight into meaningful conversation.</li>
              <li>Above average agreeableness is also an excellent trait for a group as the group can synergize and work together, aware of each other’s differences.</li>

        <article>
          <p>The Matrix Learning Style test results showed that the group prefers to learn in 3 out of the 7 possible learning styles. Solitary, Logical and Physical learning.<br>
            <ul>
              <li>Solitary – half of the group (3 members) preferred to work alone as their learning style. As several group members had this in common, we can understand each other’s needs in approaching the work required to be done.</li>
              <li>Physical – one member of the group is a physical learner, who is great for when we are engaging together as a group. Having a physical learner in the group is great for initiating the group in tasks.</li>
              <li>Logical – two members of the group preferred to use logic in learning. This can help bridge the group together between the solitary and physical learners as they are effective in solitary and physical learning styles where needed.</li>
